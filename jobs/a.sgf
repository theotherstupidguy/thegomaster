dada: serious fighting game :o)
\[one of the most interesting games I had for a long time\]
I didn't really know what was going on and how I got into this fight,
but well, that's what being a kyu player is all about :o)
Any hints about strategy appreciated.

Yes, good move, if you don't play it your opponent will
and the marked stone will then be very "active".

I was pretty happy with this move -
if W wants to live small it's ok by me :o)

You're right, there is no reason for white to "panic".
The normal move at A is the usual procedure to reduce
black's moyo. See the variation for a possible continuation.

C[
dada:
correct? other ideas?

jansteen:
You want a move which splits the white marked stones
so white will be forced to live in the corner. Kosumi
usually is bad shape but in this case seems ok.
Personally, I prefer the ikken-tobi to A (variation)
since that move also builds up black's bottom moyo.

I wanted to put pressure on W, that's why I didn't play hane at 'a',
as W would certainly cross-cut and make sabaki easily.

C[
dada:
right strategy?
my idea was W 'a', B 'b' building the bottom,
then switch to the top left.

jansteen:
This is too easy for white and what I also don't
like about this move is that it doesn't accomplish
a lot in the center. The marked white stone is
captured as it is.

I prefer the move in the variation.

C[
dada:
the result wasn't good for me - what else should I do?
I still think the game is pretty close, is it?

jansteen:
When counting it's important to see your priviledge in UR (variation).
Black has 12 in LR, 10 in UR and 40 in LL., total: 62.
White has 7 on right side, 22 in UR, 7 in LL, 10 in UL + komi, total 51.5.
So you're about ten points ahead but white can create more
territory at either the top or left side. The game is about even I would
say since white's LR group is weak as well (variation).

dada:
This is the phase of the middle game where I lose oversight.

C[
dada:
W builds the top - I'm falling behind in territory.
My only chance is to gain profit by attacking the weak
W group in the lower right.
Correct analysis?

jansteen:
Actually white's last move enables you to exploit the weaknesses
at the top later so the top is not territory yet..
Right now black A is most important since it gives you a strong
group and territory and weakens his group.

Quite a difference with some previous variations here.

C[
dada:
it took ages to come up with this move -
but I'm still not convinced that it's right. Can I live here?

jansteen:
You played aji-keshi moves from the inside.
This makes it much harder to live. Judging from the
game you might indeed be dead here.

By the way, the marked exchange is bad, you might
want to cut the other way around to fight with the
corner (the liberties are different).
