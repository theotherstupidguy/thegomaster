PW[Iyama Yuta]PB[Kono Rin]WR[9d]BR[9d]DT[2013-08-23]EV[38th Gosei title match]RO[Game 5]PC[Osaka, Japan]SO[http://gogameguru.com/]AN[An Younggil 8p]C[This is the final game from the 38th Gosei title match, between Iyama Yuta 9p and Kono Rin 9p. 

It was played at the Nihon Ki-in Kansai branch in Osaka, on August 23, 2013.

Iyama Yuta is the #1 player in Japan, and he's also Japan's greatest hope on the international Go scene. He recently won the 25th TV Asian Cup for the first time, defeating Park Junghwan 9p, and defended his Honinbo title against Takao Shinji 9p too.

He challenged for the Gosei last year, and defeated Hane Naoki 9p 3-0 in the final to take the Gosei title. Therefore, this final was his first time defending the Gosei.

Kono Rin 9p was born in 1981, and he became a pro in 1996. 

He won the 1st JAL New Stars Haya Go tournament in 2004, and it was his first title. He won the 31st Tengen, defeating Yamashita Keigo 9p 3-2 in 2005, and that was his first major title.

He defended the Tengen title for the two following years, defeating Yamashita Keigo 9p in 2006 and 2007. He also won the 29th NEC Cup in 2010, and he recently challenged Iyama Yuta to reclaim the Tengen title (2012), but was defeated 3-0.

This final was seen as a kind of grudge match for Kono Rin, and he won the first two games with his powerful style of play. However, Iyama won the next two games, making it a tie.

This final game would decide the best of five Gosei title match. In general, we'd expect Iyama to have the psychological advantage going into this final game, because he was in good form and was on a winning streak.

Let's have a look at the final game of the 38th Gosei title match.

Iyama Yuta defended his Gosei title against Kono Rin, by winning three games in a row, after losing the first two games.

The opening was favorable for black, and black was in the lead when he played at A. However, black made a mistake with B, and the game was suddenly reversed by the ko fight.

Despite that, the game was still very close, and C became the winning move. After that, black kept trying to catch up and complicated the game with D, but Iyama's responses were perfect - even under the time pressure - and black couldn't grasp any chances to reverse the game.

Iyama still holds five of the seven major titles in Japan, and soon he's going to challenge Yamashita Keigo 9p for the Meijin title.

On the other hand, it was a very unfortunate result for Kono Rin. He won the first two games, and he only needed to win one more of the next three games, but he wasn't able to do so. However, it was still a very impressive final series by Kono Rin.

The game ended at 8:50pm in Japan, and both players were on their last byo-yomi.

This game was very interesting and exciting, right up until the end of the game. I hope you'll enjoy reviewing this game more with this commentary. If you have any questions or opinions, please feel free to leave a comment.
