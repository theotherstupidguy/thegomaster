C[Wnw: Hello, I'm WindnWater. I feel that I got lost in the opening (as usual) and started a fight to cach up. It evolved into a whole-board fight and I was disadvantaged all throughout, it was a miracle it lasted so many moves. I think i need to improve on my whole board thinking, as I tend to start obstinate fights too many times, but I also would like some help with the complicated middle game fights that I could barely handle. Maybe both sides missed some crucial tesujis?

Thank you very much, WindnWater.



Hello, WindnWater! 

My name is Bernd, HonFu here in the GTL and in other go places.

This game is a very nice one to review, because you are violating one important principle of go consequently. For a reviewer this is great, because you get one topic to talk about (instead of commenting on this and that without a real line), and for the student it is great because he has something - ONE thing - which he can understand directly, change it and thereby immediately improve. (In this case this is really true!)

There are some go proverbs that try to point out this principle in a zeny way, like "Don't go on the hunt, while the house is burning" or "Make a fist before you strike".

The one thing we really have to watch out for in fighting is, that before we attack, we must defend ourselves! 

The typical GOOD move therefore is a move that defends yourself while threatening your opponent; the typical BAD move is helping your opponent to defend while you remain weak.

This may sound kind of obvious, but we miss this in many games, and especially in this game, it played a huge role.

So let's take a look!];B[qd];W[qp];B[dp];W[dc];B[op];W[pn];B[qq]
;W[nq]TR[qp]C[Hon: I never saw this.

It looks kind of strange - you just threatened the marked stone, and White ignores you to put a weak stone on the other side.]

(;B[po]C[WnW: I think the result after this move was bad for black. But I had no clue about where I should play.

Hon: This is very bad shape.];W[qo]C[Hon: The reason is, that you strengthen the opponent, while you remain just as weak as before yourself. 

Make a fist before you strike!];B[on];W[pm];B[om];W[pl];B[lp]
C[Hon: On first glance this looks like you have pressed and pincered. But first of all, you pushed on the fourth line for this (you shouldn't!), and second ...]

(;W[mp];B[lq];W[mo]C[Hon: White creates a weak group for no reason.]

(;B[ol]
(;W[lo];B[jp]
(;W[rq];B[pk]LB[oq:A]C[Wnw: I thought the game was good for white and wanted to cause complications. This is my aggressive style, but was it an overplay?

Hon: I think, this is rather a strategical move instead of an aggressive move. The aim is surrounding the opponent and gaining influence. If it is an overplay, I am not sure myself (see variations of some possibilities) ... but I would prefer to just block at A for now.]

(;W[ok]C[Hon: This looks a bit hurried to me.];B[ll]C[Wnw: Is this correct shape?

Hon: I am not sure. It works as a connection for the moment. In most cases you would prefer the one point jump anyway, for a bit more solidity, so that the opponent doesn't get so many forcing moves later.]
;W[jo]
(;B[kn]C[Hon: Peeps strengthen the opponent and destroy possibilities, so you have to think hard if you really need them!]
;W[ko]
(;B[io]LB[ip:A]C[WnW: I felt that moving at A might be too passive, but playing here seemed to leave a bit of adji.

Hon: I understand your idea, but this is really a bad move. 

Why?

It's the same principle again - you help the opponent but don't do anything for yourself.]

(;W[in];B[ho];W[jn]
(;B[pp]LB[pk:A]C[Wnw: I intended to try activating the stone at A indirectly, but now I suspect that it could in fact be adji-keshi or even bad shape.

Hon: That sounds like you want to attack the white group. But first you should make sure that you are strong yourself!]
;W[qr];B[qn]LB[ol:C][rl:A][kp:B]C[Wnw: I'm not sure if this helped me much. I think it helped white. Is A okay?

Hon: It all looks messy now. The problem is that White has no real weak points. He is virtually connected at the bottom and alive in the corner, while you still have problems to solve (B and C)]
;W[qm];B[rn];W[rm];B[pq];W[ro];B[or]C[Wnw: In retrospect, this seems to be almost a pass move.

Hon: And you played all those moves before, which only helped your opponent!]
;W[nr]LB[kp:B][oq:A]C[Wnw: Not sure why white played here.

Hon: It is the same reason for which you should have played A much earlier - White threatens to connect to the corner, which strengthens him, and at the same time prevents your connection, which weakens you. (On the other hand, maybe the option of B was enough for self-defence already.)]
;B[hn]
(;W[km];B[jk];W[hm];B[gm];W[hl];B[gl];W[hk];B[jl];W[jm]LB[kp:A]
[pr:B]C[Hon: It is funny - White played the last moves as if A and B weren't there.]

(;B[oj]C[Wnw: Was this a good move? I misread and thought I could capture white.

Hon: It is the kind of move that is bad, when it doesn't work, and great if it works.]
;W[nk];B[nj];W[mk];B[lj]C[Wnw: Sloppy by me; it's actually not that hard for me to read that I cannot capture, my reading skills are ahead of my postional judgement.

Hon: It is harder to read in a game than in a problem. I often mess up easy things which I would laugh about in a tsumego. :-)]
;W[pj];B[qk];W[mj]
(;B[mm]LB[mi:A][oj:B]C[Wnw: Suddenly, I realized that A won't work. Am I right?

If A doesn't work, then B was really a bad move.];W[lm];B[ml]

(;W[mi];B[pi]C[Hon: Suddenly Black's situation has improved somewhat, because White now also has a weak group to worry about.]
;W[lh];B[jh]LB[ji:A]C[WnW: Is this move correct shape?

Hon: Like in the former example this move may hold for the moment, but turn sour later. You can only rely on your reading, but among strong players there is a tendency, in case of doubt, to choose the safer move, for example A. Of course, A would put less pressure on the White stones ... this is a dilemma in every game - we want two things at the same time, but we can't have them ... ^^]
;W[fj];B[ki]LB[ji:A]C[Wnw: A weird move, but I thought that solidifying  this group would force white to choose to help one, and I could initiate a do-or-die splitting attack.

Hon: If you want to defend now, then you should have played A in the first place.

On the other hand, ironically, this is the first time you applied our principle yourself - defend first, attack later! 

But the idea of do-or-die is not correct. By defending you DEFEND! So you probably won't die. Do-or-die was what you did in the 68 moves before - attacking without protecting yourself first.

(Also you should again take a look at the bottom group - White can connect or capture some stones, so he is not really weak enough for you to hope for an attack.)]
;W[oh];B[gk]LB[hj:A]C[Wnw: Is A the corect move? If I were white I would avoid complications.]
;W[gj]
(;B[pg]LB[qg:A]C[Wnw: I think the cut at A is possible now.

Hon: If you don't cut now, then why did you push? 

If you push, then you cut - and you have to read it out before!

(Instead of this move - A!)];W[ph];B[qh];W[qg];B[rh];W[qf];B[mf]

(;W[kg];B[hh]LB[hj:A]C[Wnw: Now I wish I played at A, I don't see how white can respond to A. Can you?

Hon: No, I think, the cut would have worked. But if you weren't sure about this in the game, why did you push at all? Sorry for nagging about this, but it is really important! You only play moves with a clear aim.

(And again: Cutting is not a big threat, when White can just live down there.)]
;W[hi];B[of];W[pe]
(;B[oe]TR[pe][qf][qg]C[Wnw: I decided not to captur these stones and gather strength to kill the L13 group, but now I wonder if I was going too far.

Hon: This is definitely hoping for too much while also giving away too much!]
;W[pd]TR[qd][oe]C[Hon: This is one of the most ugly shapes in go - you force your opponent to cut you apart. You lose the corner that was yours, you just hand it over, for a slight chance of MAYBE killing White's group. 

You should try to attack in a way so that you don't have to pay for what you take. 

Or putting it differently - you strengthen the opponent (by making him kill your stone) and don't really do anything substantial for your own stones.]

(;B[ke]LB[pc:B][od:A]C[Wnw: Maybe I should do the A-B exchange first. Even this move is questionable.

Hon: A-B only increases your loss, since it loses any possibility to still live with the corner stone.]
;W[jf];B[hd]LB[he:A]C[Wnw: I think this should be at A.

Hon: Both this move and A are all-out moves unlikely to work. Both moves do not defend either the upper or the lower group.

It is not easy to say, but in this fight, generally you are having such a hard time to find for a good follow-up, because you attack from a weak position. 

So let me say it again - make a fist, before you strike! Don't go on the hunt, while the house is burning!]
;W[je];B[jd]C[Hon: This hane leaves a cutting point.];W[he]
;B[ge];W[hf]TR[io]C[Hon: Now you have one more hane for a cutting point. You are repeating the mistake of the marked stone.]
;B[gg]C[Hon: This move is now necessary, but it just forces White to hack you into pieces, which is what he was going to do anyway.]
;W[gf];B[eg];W[ff]TR[pd][qd][ge][oe][pe][gf][hf][gg]C[Hon: This is a repetition of the mistake in the upper right. 

White just barges through your stones, and instead of achieving anything, you just strengthened the opponent while hurting yourself.]
;B[dj]C[Wnw: Last chance.]
(;W[ek];B[em];W[dk];B[cj];W[ck];B[cm];W[gh];B[hg];W[fg];B[fh]
;W[gi];B[ij]
(;W[ii];B[hj];W[pr]LB[kd:A][qd:C][le:B][ch:F][kp:E]C[Hon: Okay, now let us look at what has happened. On the surface you may feel like you attacked, but failed somehow. 

If we really look at it, though, basically you only attacked yourself! I have marked all your weakpoints (the big group is beyond weak already). None of them was caused by White, but you did it all to yourself!]
;B[jg];W[kf];B[ei]C[Hon: You seem to be getting a chance here, but White has helped a bit.]

(;W[bj];B[bi];W[bl];B[bm];W[bh];B[ai]LB[ci:A]C[WnW: Should this be at A?

Hon: It does not really matter anymore, but generally, if you can cut, you cut.]
;W[ch];B[aj];W[bk];B[ci];W[dh];B[eh];W[de];B[cf];W[bf];B[dg]
LB[ce:A]C[Wnw: I spent forever on this move, but I overlooked the simplest continuation for A--]
;W[ce];B[bg];W[cg]C[Wnw: I realized it was game over, and decided to find a place to resign.]
;B[df];W[ag];B[be];W[bd];B[ee];W[ef];B[ae];W[ad];B[cd];W[dd]
;B[cc];W[cb];B[ah];W[af];B[di];W[bg];B[be];W[ae]C[W+R

Thanks very much for reviewing my game, I hope you can point out any flaws in my thinking.

I feel that I made the game difficult for myself, but I'm not sure what would have been better.

WindnWater

Hon: Probably now you already know a lot better what went wrong. The main flaw in your thinking was not to mind your own safety, which was also what made the game difficult for you.

If I put it like this, it may sound ridiculously simple, but I know that it is not! If we saw that we are in trouble, we would change something, right? Problem is we don't see, because fights feel confusing, there's so much to look at, to analyze, to read, that we miss the most essential, easy things.

What we need is a concept that clarifies things, that helps us to get our priorities straight.

One idea that has helped many players goes as follows - with every move, right from the start up to the end of the game, you ask yourself three questions: 1.) Am I in trouble somewhere? 2.) Is my opponent in trouble somewhere? 3.) Is there a big move?

If you find that you are in trouble somewhere, then you HAVE TO defend! No matter what may be up else, if you are in trouble, you have to defend, now!

If you are NOT in trouble, only then you may ask yourself the second question. And if you find out that he IS in trouble (while you are not!), then you have to look for ways to make him suffer!

And only if you find, that neither you, nor your opponent are in trouble, then you are allowed to play a move, that is just big and nothing else. The trouble points always come first, and first of first, YOUR trouble points have to be settled.

The art, now, is to find moves that 1.) defend our own weakness, 2.) attack your opponents weakness, and 3.) take profit at the same time! 

But if you feel like you want to attack, although you haven't solved your own trouble, then you are getting on the wrong track, and generally, the game will go like this one. Stop yourself from this!

Try looking at a joseki book with these three questions in mind - suddenly a lot of moves become very easy to understand! It is always the striving to be 1.) safe yourself, 2.) attack the opponent, and 3.) take some profit, if possible, at the same time, but always in this order of priority! 

If you try this in your own games, they will be a lot less confusing and dangerous for you. Generally it should improve your go and make you win more games in the long run.

I hope this review gave you something to work with. Good luck with your studies!
