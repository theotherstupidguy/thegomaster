 imp NR : i expected r14 instead of o17. Is that also possible?
 jansteen 3d*:  Yes, seems very normal
 imp NR : ok, thx
 jansteen 3d*:  Now black plays in lower-right, ideas?
 darkoasis 1k*:  black Q6
 jansteen 3d*:  right, correct
 imp NR : wow:)
 jansteen 3d*:  Black in lower-left is solid and low so black wants white to move that way
 jansteen 3d*:  So black approaches from the right side
 imp NR : r6 not better?

 jansteen 3d*:  Nicely balanced
 jansteen 3d*:  Yes imp, very good :)
 jansteen 3d*:  So now white has to choose between two moves: c17 or g17, which do you choose?
 darkoasis 1k*:  C17...although I would have played H17
 darkoasis 1k*:  I meant G17
 imp NR : i would c6 here:)
 jansteen 3d*:  oh, sorry, choice is c17 or h17
 darkoasis 1k*:  H17 for me.
 imp NR : ok, i take c17 to keep things interesting:)
 jansteen 3d*:  c6 is big, but upper-side is hot area, one who plays first can determine the flow
 jansteen 3d*:  so 50/50 :)

 jansteen 3d*:  Ok, now the flow of the game is set
 jansteen 3d*:  Look at the whole board and try to find the strategic key points
 darkoasis 1k*:  black wants O13...
 imp NR : o13 a must now...
 darkoasis 1k*:  white wants P10
 imp NR : and then w can c6:)
 jansteen 3d*:  very good guys!

 jansteen 3d*:  Black now decided to invade the white moyo, any ideas? :)
 jansteen 3d*:  Consider the weaknesses in the white position
 darkoasis 1k*: black D10 is the most obvious...
 jansteen 3d*:  Yes, d10 rather tradition reducing move
 jansteen 3d*:  d10 or e10
 darkoasis 1k*: black really needs M12...
 darkoasis 1k*: but from your comment...we can count that out :)
 imp NR : hi:)
 jansteen 3d*:  homeless: black to invade the white moyo, ideas?
 imp NR : i see nothing but g14, but that seems no succes...
 darkoasis 1k*: black K13 is not an invasion...but black might consider it.
 jansteen 3d*:  Yes, d10 was suggested as traditional reducing move
 darkoasis 1k*: black G13 seems too close...
]
;B[jf]C[
 darkoasis 1k*: but it would definitely invade.
 jansteen 3d*:  Aiming the weakness of the h17 stones
 jansteen 3d*:  Black k14 makes moving with g16 and covering with m13 miai
 darkoasis 1k*: why is K14 considered an invasion?...seems outright reckless to me.
 imp NR : no dark, this is normal idea, like d10/e10
 jansteen 3d*:  No oasis, k14 is the kind of move which makes opponent worry
 imp NR : but i would call it a reduction too:)
 darkoasis 1k*: Okay...but I think...after black K14...
 jansteen 3d*:  well, fighting spirit calls now for...?
 darkoasis 1k*: white should jump to M12...then counter-invade at Q10.
 darkoasis 1k*: I would escalate the hostilities here...
]
;W[lh]C[
 darkoasis 1k*: if black wants a fight...give it to him!!
 imp NR : i vote m12 too
]
;B[jh]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  And now?
 darkoasis 1k*: white O12 or O11...
 darkoasis 1k*: aiming to go in much further.
 darkoasis 1k*: another move is to cap at K10
 darkoasis 1k*: and let black tell me which way to go.
 jansteen 3d*:  hello? :)
 mattias 13k*:  l15 bad?
 darkoasis 1k*: I gave my moves...cap at K10 or attach at O12
 imp NR : is r12 possible?
 darkoasis 1k*: I like to Q10, too, Homeless...
 darkoasis 1k*: but I think white needs one more move to set it up.
 imp NR : give us a hint, jansteen!
 darkoasis 1k*: cap at K10...then strike at Q8.
]
;W[jj]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  i don't continue if you don't give suggestions :)
 darkoasis 1k*: *I* am playing the white stones...
 jansteen 3d*:  yes, imp and oasis suggested the game move
 darkoasis 1k*: I don't care how black moves here...
 darkoasis 1k*: white is ready to hit at the pressure points.
 jansteen 3d*:  My network is slow, maybe we all suffer?
 darkoasis 1k*: If blacks moves to L11...white can consider Q8...
 imp NR : afraid you suffer alone:)
 jansteen 3d*:  The idea of k10 is: if black turns right, white moves into black's right side territory
 darkoasis 1k*: but I think black will move the other direction...since he is invading!! hehe
 jansteen 3d*:  If black moves left white's left side can be build/protected
]
;B[ki]
;W[mi]C[
 imp NR : i would like to move upwards, but no good move i think:(
 jansteen 3d*:  Now black starts moving g16, ideas?
 darkoasis 1k*: Imp...you have *all* the magic...Black needs a rabbit right now!!
 darkoasis 1k*: if black moves G16...then G14 seems to be the only way to move that stone.
]
;B[id]C[
 darkoasis 1k*: G14 allows black to change his mind...and later play around H11 or so.
 imp NR : but what if w push es up and keeps on pushing?
 jansteen 3d*:  45th Oza: Yamada Kimio (7d,B) vs Ryu Shikun (8p,W)
 darkoasis 1k*: black J14 must mean...that black is aiming to cut around N14 or N15.
 imp NR : i vote h16 and push and push...
 darkoasis 1k*: he also wants to push down at J17, and attach at N17, too,
 darkoasis 1k*: N18, too
]
;W[ic]C[
 darkoasis 1k*: right now...white needs to defend around K18...
 imp NR : nice kikashi now..:)

;W[kc]
;B[ig]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  Black j13 defends against l15
 darkoasis 1k*: yes...but white N11 was too slow...now white is heavy in the center.
 imp NR : bad shape for w in center
 jansteen 3d*:  White's move, direction?
 darkoasis 1k*: white might try Q12 here to fix up his shape.
 jansteen 3d*:  q12 seems risky?
 jansteen 3d*:  Yes, Yu

;W[mk]C[
 darkoasis 1k*: Q12 is very risky...
 darkoasis 1k*: but that's GO!! hehe

;B[pk]
;W[hf]C[
 darkoasis 1k*: Jan...
 darkoasis 1k*: in this position...
 jansteen 3d*:  yes?
 darkoasis 1k*: white might have considered Q8 instead of Q10.
 darkoasis 1k*: then white can strike at H14 as he did.
 darkoasis 1k*: well...we can continue :)
 jansteen 3d*:  yes, maybe, interesting idea, especially considering the game continuation
 jansteen 3d*:  White h14 is kikashi but black plays kiai
]
;B[nj]
;W[mj]
;B[ni]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  Black built a large territory, allowing white to capture the cutting stones
 darkoasis 1k*: kiai = miai
 jansteen 3d*:  kiai is kind of determined, going own way
 imp NR : fighting spirit..
 jansteen 3d*:  pro's do it all the time actually, very important concept
 darkoasis 1k*: then it means *stubborn* hehe
 imp NR : yes
 jansteen 3d*:  In ama games players follow too often, in pro games players seek own ways

;B[hk]C[
 imp NR : otherwise white l9 (if not b k9) ?
 darkoasis 1k*: black has poked his head out...
 jansteen 3d*:  Hmm, suddenly we entered new phase
 darkoasis 1k*: at the expense of some big crumbs.
 jansteen 3d*:  Yes imp, that seems a one sided fight once n9 is strong
]
;W[cn]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  c6 big :)
 imp NR : finally:)
 darkoasis 1k*: the oba at K4 is now huge...
 jansteen 3d*:  And now?
 darkoasis 1k*: but white should at least pick up the crumbs at the top.
 imp NR : m3 or so?
 jansteen 3d*:  build with k4 or reduce with d10 around?
 darkoasis 1k*: black should play J14...
 darkoasis 1k*: those crumbs are big.
 jansteen 3d*:  hmm, j14 is black's priviledge already
 imp NR : hm, w f9 big?
]
;B[dj]C[
 darkoasis 1k*: then black may as well play N3 and hash the gane out.

;B[bq]
;W[dp]C[

 jansteen 3d*:  yes, me too :)

;B[co]
;W[dq]
;B[do]C[
 imp NR : well, well:)
 jansteen 3d*:  another example of "kiai"
 darkoasis 1k*: both sides are now playing *kiai*...
 darkoasis 1k*: and black is getting the raw deal here...

 darkoasis 1k*: white's position is too strong for this.

;B[cj]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  Suddenly white's upper-left under attack
 jansteen 3d*:  Besides lower-left needing support now
 imp NR : does g15/g14 defends against g10 jan?
 imp NR : w g13 now?
 jansteen 3d*:  The cut at g10 is gone now I think because c9 too weak
 imp NR : that would *not* be kiai:)
 imp NR : i would gert nervous with w here:)
 darkoasis 1k*: white needs E12 or D12
]
;W[eg]C[
 darkoasis 1k*: white's J15 move was too slow...
 imp NR : b6?
 jansteen 3d*:  This sequence started with c5 and resulted in this position
 jansteen 3d*:  Black started by sacrificing something (shimari in LL)
 jansteen 3d*:  But whole board: black is ok
 jansteen 3d*:  Next move?
 jansteen 3d*:  Yes, imp, b6 correct direction
 imp NR : or f3...
]
;B[dn]C[
 mattias 13k*:  c7 bad?
 jansteen 3d*:  d6 same idea but more effect on lower-side
 jansteen 3d*:  c7 is also correct direction, d6 attacks whole group, it's more severe in a sense
 imp NR : if b c7, then w d6 heavy on b?
]
;W[fq]
;B[fn]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  Not sure imp :)
 jansteen 3d*:  I think we would get this position but with f6 at c7, it would be smaller for black

 darkoasis 1k*: laughing out loud. :)
 jansteen 3d*:  Oh :)
 jansteen 3d*:  Yes, agree imp, black played very all-out :)
 jansteen 3d*:  This game gave Yamada the Oza title
 mattias 13k*: correct me if wrong but w played bad in lower left when approaching there?
 darkoasis 1k*: Jan...thanks again...We appreciate this. :)
 imp NR : we could not say that mattias, even after many hiours analysing...
 imp NR : simply too difficult
 jansteen 3d*:  mattias: The commentary said white 98 (h2) is probably the loosing move
 jansteen 3d*:  White should have added a move in the center at that point
 mattias 13k*: ok thanks
 imp NR : well, thx for that info:)
 jansteen 3d*:  But imp is right, even pro's have to analyse for hours to say more about a game
 jansteen 3d*:  This game is so complicated :)
