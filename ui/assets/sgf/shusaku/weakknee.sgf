Dear Kishiko,

Here is a recent 10/15 game from IGS. I played white and managed to
win, but black let me of the hook with slow moves a few times. Could
you please have a look at it? My main problem is bad direction of
play, which I tend to straighten out with unreasonable fighting :\)
So, please criticize anything that doesn't strike you as natural.

Best wishes,

Klaus Pulverer, M"unchen(weakknee on IGS\)

black's position.]

C[
weakknee: Is this the correct point for a pincer?

kishiko: I would prefer "j4", since this game invites "high" moves.

C[
weakknee: Generally, I dislike playing against the Chinese Fuseki because
I always seem to manage to mess it up. As in this case ... please
tell me what you think about this  sequence + alternatives.

kishiko: This move is ok, it stresses black's lack of attacking potential.
Both marked stones are low, so it's easy to settle this stone, and/or
escape.

This is ok, leaning against the black strong position. The
move you're aiming at is "a" though, making a base.

Not to the point! The right side is most important. The stronger
you are, the more options you'll create for later on.

C[
Wrong direction, b15, inviting black to invest the left side
is the move here. The marked stones are a wall, you should drive the
opponent towards that wall.

C[Good, making white invest here.]

stones\). Also, the white stone at c12 is still looking at "a".

B[cd]
;
L[fb]
C[They play the lower atari recently, but this move is ok as well.]
W[gc]
;
L[be]
C[Black doesn't defend "a". Also, this move peeps at a cutting
point, so it doesn't feel good. How about q11 instead?]
B[qn]
;
W[qh]
C[
weakknee: Is this the correct kind of idea? the 5 stones on the bottom
right seem fairly worthless now.

kishiko: Like black's move at "f17", this is overplay. Two weak groups.
]
;
B[qo]
C[
weakknee: slow I think.

kishiko: Slow or "thick" is a thin line. It seems slow, but black
takes a lot of profit and strength with this move.

C[Greedy, anyway \(3,3\) is open, and the white marked stone
is peeping as well, so it's rather small here. better play in the
centre: "a".]
