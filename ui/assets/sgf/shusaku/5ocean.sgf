stones while pushing down the white stone.]

C[The situation on the right looks like the normal joseki with
the difference that white's corner is smaller. I am not sure about
black q10 though. It leaves white with an invasion at \[a\].]
B[pj]
;
W[cn]
;
Letter[cl][cq][cp]
C[Can't be bad, though I would play at \[a\], to invite white
to play more moves on the lower edge after he invades with \[b\],
B\[c\], et cetera...]
B[fq]
;
W[nc]
;
Letter[kd][lc]
C[Personally, I don't like tsuke-nobi. It builds up power, but
at the price of strengthening the opponent. I would have played pincer
with either \[a\] or \[b\], but it's stricktly personal opinion.]
B[nd]
;
W[md]
;
B[ne]
;
W[qc]
;
C[Good move, the only way to use the local stones efficiently.
It will hurt the right side position though. But that's Go: give
and  take :-\)]

C[And black has sente, also useful of course, and has to be
taken into consideration while choosing the joseki in the upper-right.]
;
B[cl]
C[In this position a leasury move would be at \[a\] \(white
\[b\], black \[c\]\). It protects against the white invasion at \[d\],
sets up the large follow up at \[e\] and is in tune with black's \
thickness  overall. The move actually played is more aggressive, and \
definitely  not bad. Maybe it's even better, a matter of taste.]
Letter[np][mp][mo][pl][qh]
;
W[cp]
C[San-san might be more normal in this position.]
;
B[cq]
;

;
B[bp]
C[Quite a decision by black!]
;
W[co]
;
B[br]
;
W[dq]
;
B[cr]
;
W[bo]
C[Bad since it's aji keshi \(spoiling the future possibility
of white \[a\]. Besides, it's bad shape.]
Letter[aq]
;
B[aq]
;
W[ep]
;
B[do]
;
W[eq]
C[Overplay, the black stone at f3 is light \(easy to sacrifice\),
but the white stones at e3 or c5 aren't. So white has two weak groups,
while black has none.]
;
B[eo]
;
W[fp]
;
B[dm]
C[Good combination, white lost considerably and still needs
to play at the lower side.]
;
W[gq]
;
B[el]
C[Good! A honte move, finishing the shape locally, to remove
future annoyance. A thick move.]
;
W[fo]
;
Letter[np]
C[Now, a move around \[a\] would have double value, building \
up own position, while reducing the opponents position.]
B[dd]
;
W[dc]
;
Letter[ed]
C[No, too much aimed at the left side, while ignoring the overall \
position of black's stones. The only move is at \[a\].]
B[cd]
;
Letter[ed][ee][fe]
C[I would play \[a\], \[b\], \[c\] when I'd play white.]
W[bd]
;
B[be]
;
W[bc]
;
C[Good, increasing the liberties of black's stones.]
B[ed]
;
W[fc]
;
C[Humm, I'm not sure about this move. Too difficult to give \
an oppinion without studying the position thoroughly.]
B[fd]
;
W[gc]
;
Letter[hc][gd]
C[But, pushing once, and then play elsewhere is *not* good. \
The push strengthens white considerably \(the weakness at \[a\] is \
gone for example\). The only move is keep on pushing with \[b\]. Of \
course, the move played is also very valuable.]
B[mo]
;
Letter[fm][fl]
C[I would play the kikashi at \[a\] instead. It will have a \
follow up with \[b\] later on.]
W[fn]
;
Letter[em]
C[Maybe better to play bamboo \(black \[a\]\). It'll help more \
to invade the lower side, while taking a liberty with e6 is not useful \
in this position probably.]
B[en]
;
Letter[bf]
C[Entering the messy stage :-\). Maybe I would have started \
with \[a\] myself to check on black's response first.]
W[dh]
;
C[A confident move! Building up strength to enable a later attack.]
B[cf]
;
W[fh]
;
B[hh]
;
W[fj]
;
B[hj]
;
C[This would have been impossible when black would have played \
e6 at e7, but that's slightly coincidental. However, since white can \
play this move, maybe the previous move of black should be reconsidered.]
