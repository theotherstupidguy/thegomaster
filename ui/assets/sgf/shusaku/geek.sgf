C[
I tried to stress what I belief is the most important handicap
of players of black's strength. Since geek plans to share this
review with daveg as well, I also commented on the white moves
once in a while.

B[nd]
C[Good and positive move. Other options are one of the O-ba
points like A and B.]
Letter[dj][jp]
;
W[cn]
C[With this move white tries to prevent black from making a
san-rensei position \(three star points in a row\). A good strategy
in a handicap game.]
;
B[fp]
Mark[dd][nd]
C[Again, a good and positive move. However, since the marked
stone is on the board, black might feel tempted to try something like
diagram 1 as well.]
(

W[fc]

B[df]
Letter[jc]
C[Compared to the previous two corners, I would now suggest
a pincer around A. One of the reasons is that it would make good shape
in the upper-right. Another reason is that the usual move by white
\(the 3,3 point\) does not turn out well for white \(please see the
following diagram\).]
(
;
W[pm]
C[White plays a good fuseki \(opening\). Taking a foothold on
various parts of the board preventing black from creating a moyo \(large
framework of territory\). Still there is no reason for black to be
worried, the games seems fairly balanced \(for a handicap 4 game that is\).]
;
B[qj]
C[
Positive move: separating the white position into two seperate
groups. One remark: when playing such a splitting move it's
usually better to play the move one line higher \(at Q10\).
First of all, all black stones are in high positions so it works
together better with these previously played stones.
But also, a stone on the fourth line is saver itself.
In the subsequent fighting the marked black stone might easily
become weak itself.
Of course, it will be more difficult to do *real killing* because
white can always slide underneath that stone \(S10\), but killing
should never be the aim while attacking the opponent.
]
Mark[qj]
;
W[np]
C[Good, taking the initiative in the lower-right corner.]
;
B[oo]
C[Good approach: seperating the white stones again. Personally,
I would have choosen A though, although that doesn't imply that the
text move is inferior.]
Letter[no]
;
W[qq]
C[The normal approach in these circumstances, entering san-san
tries to settle one of white's stones, taking away black's base. The
other white stone will have to take care of itself.]
;
B[qp]
C[Probably the correct direction, although A is tempting too,
see diagram 4.]
(
;
W[pq]
;
B[no]
;
W[op]
C[The vital point in this shape, good.]
;
B[pn]
C[Too timid, better play hane at A, preparing the cut at B.
If white blocks at C, black defends at D, and the cut at E is defended
while the cut at B still exists.]
Letter[rq][oq][rr][rp][po]
;
W[rp]
C[Vital point again, stressing the lack of liberties of the
two black stones.]
Mark[qp][pp]
;
B[ro]
;
W[mo]
;
B[mp]
C[Good spirit! But taking one stone at A is huge as well since
it would: 1. make black alive, 2. threaten to cut at B, 3. take a
lot of profit. The move at A looks so small and slow but the longer
you look at that move, the larger it seems to become :-\)]
Letter[rq][oq]
;
W[rq]
C[White makes his group alive, while aiming at the cut at A.
Now it's not so clear anymore who is cutting who in the center.]
Letter[qo]
;
B[mq]
C[Just for the record: in this shape you should also consider
the shape in diagram 5.]
(
;
W[nr]
C[
 queue 17k*: n2 ]
;
B[qe]
C[Yes, queue is right, n2 is sente and big. There is no
difference in liberties though, after white answers with A.
Anyway, leaving the position like this \(with R15\) is a thin
way of playing. White has all kind of nasty attacking options in
the lower-right. Black's shape needs attention here.]

W[rn]

are working well. The normal move at A might loose two black stones
either on r7 or n4.]

B[mn]
C[How about diagram 6 instead?]
(
;
W[lo]
;
B[nm]
;
W[om]
C[It's hard to comment on such fights, because actually you
have to read out most variations quite deep \(this might sometimes
involve some 20 move sequences\). But one alternative way of playing
would be diagram 7.]
(
;
B[nn]
;
W[ok]
C[Especially in a handicap game moving these stones immediately
is very interesting way to play.]
;
B[km]
;
W[jo]
;
B[rk]
C[This move is not necessary so black looses an important tempo
here. Keypoint is A now \(to prevent white from playing there\).]
Letter[pi]
;
W[nj]
;
B[pf]
C[Good, taking a firm grip on black's stone.]
;
W[kk]
C[Good, vital point for attack. Black suddenly feels thin around
here. Thin also in the sense of *not round* \(flat\).]
;
B[ml]
C[I can imagine that you were worried about white A, but playing
from the inside like this is very painful. it's important to realise
that black can sacrifice the two marked stones \(with B for example\).
The center is top priority in this game \(in most handicap games\).]
Letter[lm][kn]
;
W[lj]
;
B[im]
;
W[ho]
;
B[gm]
C[Considered A? This should be your first impression in this
position. Therefore, I might tend to let white play B instead of the
marked move, taking a firm grip on the lower side while aiming at
C or D \(both to separate the black positions\) later on.]

C[White is succesful in the lower side fighting. White entered
the lower-left corner, and besides captured two black stones.
Besides, white can later peep at A, B, and C, so black doesn't have
a lot of center strength in return.]
Letter[jl][hl][fl]

a distance while taking territory.]

C[Heavy and might even be an overplay as well.
I would prefer to just play A. Settling in the center would enable
white to start an attack on the whole black center group.]
Letter[nh]
;
B[rf]
C[Hmm, far too submissive and wrong direction as well. The weak
group is along the side, so playing from that direction is the proper
procedure. For example, A, or B-C-D.]
Letter[ni][oh][og][mh]
;
W[ri]
C[Both players are obsessed with the connection options. In
case of white, when you want to separate, playing A might make black
feel more uncomfortable, and will give you better fighting shape.]

B[mi]

C[Better on A, the marked stone is kikashi \(forcing move\)
so don't make it heavy, or it might become a burden. A kikashi has
done its work, it can be given away... This is all theoretically speaking,
but A also affects the right side white group more than the move in
the game.]
Letter[nh]
Mark[mi]
;
W[md]
;

actually, attacking the whole white group, while aiming either K10 or
K11 in the center as well.]

can aim at moves like B, or C.]
Letter[hm][hj][jk]

W[il]

the two marked moves which have made white strong enough to attack
like this...]
Mark[jj][gj]
;
B[dl]
;
W[fj]
C[
White should just block. When black cuts, white can fight with A,
B, C. Black is too thin in the center to confine white.]
Letter[ij][ii][hi]
;
B[dk]
;
W[gi]
C[White plays solidly, good move. White can now aim various
points, like A, or B.]
Letter[di][jf]
;
B[hj]
C[Oh dear, way too heavy. I'm sorry, but this is
important. The fact that you move the marked stone means that
you tend to save kikashi stones. Please sacrifice these stones
with pleasure. This will help your game considerably, I promise
you that. A very important point to aim for is A, but also B is
urgent.]

C[Final comments:
A very nice game to comment on, full of interesting fighting
and played by two players with a positive attitude to Go. Black
used his handicap stones to fight, which shows a good sense of
efficiency. The black player should try to learn to recognise
kikashi stones and deal with them as such: I want to see him to
give them away next time.
The white player showed a good sense of direction \(especially
in the opening stages\). Later on \(in the center fight\) he
didn't play patient enough \(while dealing with his weak center
group\).  Both players showed a good basic knowledge of Go and
shapes in general.

C[White's position on the left turns out to be low on both sides
\(both stones on the third line\). This is unsatisfactory. Black's
next move could be either A, or the sequence B, C, D. Because this
is not fully satisfactory for white, he'll probably won't enter san-san
after black's marked move, but play as in diagram 3 instead.]

it nicely combines an attack \(upper-left\) with an extension \(from

the stone on c14 is played with a double meaning this is not so dissatisfying
