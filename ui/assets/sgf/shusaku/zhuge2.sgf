C[An unfinished game on IGS
Hi Jan,

Recently I have been reading a "Selected Openings" by Go Seigen, and
I learned a tesuji to seal a corner from outside.  I have used it
twice in real games on IGS.  The first time I made one move wrong
and the seal wasn't perfect and later seemed to cost me the game.
 The second time seemed to be a great success (I understood that
move this time), but the game was adjourned after about 100 moves.
 Luckily I remember the moves, and I would like to ask your comments.
 I made some brief comments too.

BTW, I feel this is a good chance to tell you yet another alias of
mine, and I did it in the game comments. :-)

Thanks in advance,

Kind regards, Jim ]

me something I really like.

In the game white played (a). The variations show another possibility
for whites next move.]

Yes one should push opponent's stones towards own thickness.  But

Better just jump to (o8) is better. If you attack a group you should
try to keep a distance and also to keep your positions strong.]

The game is adjourned here.  I came very close to deliever a decisive
blow, but now it seems to be still playable for W.

B is still better, isn't he?

(Jan & Kishiko:)
It's difficult. Since the upper white group can live, the black center
group is weak now. It's still an open game to us.

This move should also be expected when playing the cross-cut
variation at B(n17). The aim of this kosumi is two folded: White
aims at (a) in the corner, and (b) to capture the cutting stone.
Blacks answer is difficult since it has to take care of both treaths.

End of variation.

The black corner has a strong shape although still two cutting points
(at (a) and (b)).

This diagram shows that black shouldn't play this variation under
all circumstances since white gets quite strong at the upper edge
too. Normally black is only willing to give white this strong shape
when the resulting strength along the upper edge is overconcentrated.

The position in the diagram would be a great succes for black
since the marked white stone is too low (inefficient) in this position.
That stone should be at (a) or (b).

Later black can make white even more overconcentrated by playing the
sequence (a), (c), (d). This sequence will enlarge the black
influence on the left edge and flatten whites position.]
