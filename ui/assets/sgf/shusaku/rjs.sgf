C[You don't need to answer here. For example, you could consider
 to play at "a", to make the lower-edge good shape.]

L[lc][kc]
C[White should playan extension at "a" or "b". A black move
 there would leave the white stones around p16 without a base to live.]

C[Although a joseki variation this move is not good for white
 here. The reason is in diagram "ladder". An alternative way for white
 is in diagram "better line".]

C[I would play "a" here, probably without the marked exchange.
 The white shape on the left doesn't feel good to leave like this.]

L[cf][fc][pl]
M[hq]
C[Because of the marked stone \(solid position\) it's not really
 valuable to settle yourself in the lower-right. Two areas which attract
 my attention: upper-left \("a", or "b"\), or a pincer along the right
 side \(around "c"\).]
B[qo]

C[An impressive move, very big but hard to play because it feels slow.
A good move Rob]
B[bo]
;
W[cn]
;
L[bm][fc]
C[Wrong direction since white is open along the left side \("a"\).
 The concept of being "open" somewhere is important. Basically it
 means that white has to add another move sometime, making the
 profit worth about half the usual value.
 So, as you will understand now, "b" is the right direction here
 \(inviting white to invest stones at the worthless left edge\).]
B[cf]

W[ce]

C[Bad move, for the reason previously mentioned.]
W[ck]

L[ej][kc]
C[Way too small, "a" or "b" seems more interesting.]
B[bn]
;
W[cm]
;
L[kc][nc]
C[Playing at "a" instead would ensure you of a base for your
 group \(next is either "b" or "h17"\).]
B[hc]
;
W[kc]
C[This moves serves two purposes: an extension for the white \
group in the upper-right, and an attack on your stone. You shouldn't
have given your opponent this opportunity. That's part of the game,
playing strong moves, but also preventing attractive moves to your
opponent.]
;
B[fb]
C[A bit soft, "a" seems more interesting. Another \(more leasurely\)
 approach would be to jump to "b", with follow-up's at either "c", or "d".]
L[ec][he][ke][cc]
;
W[db]
;
B[he]
C[You can see the difference now, because of the marked exchange you
 lost the opportunity at "a". The marked exchange feels aji-keshi now.]
M[fb][db]
L[cc]
;
W[ff]

B[eg]

the left group fight for itself.]

doesn't "hurt" your opponent.]
L[mb][ob]

B[pf]
C[First play "a", because "b" is painful for your shape.]

C[Better at "a", in the endgame the same, but better \(larger\) eye space.]

C[Would white ever want to play here? :-\)
 This move erases the possibility to give atari at "a" \(or maybe even
 a throw-in at "b"\) later on. Be careful with this kind of move, they
 can be the difference between life and death.]

C[The end of this variation. Since black has still aji with
the g3 stone this result is better for him. The aji could be a peep
at "a" or "b", or maybe even escape with "c" or "d" when black gets
stones in the vicinity.]
