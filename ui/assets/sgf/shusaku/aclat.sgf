C[
The first thing to note in this position is that all black
stones are high. High stones are useful for attack, but not quite
useful for territory. So black should try to keep white's groups
weak to enable the black handicap stones to do their work.

Another application of high stones is to build up a large framework (moyo).
This can  be one of the things black could do while attacking white
stones/groups.

W[ip]
C[
Because white is strong here, he can aim: c3 and/or r3. j4
is what they call a "thick" move. A thick move makes ones own position
strong, and aims at various weaknesses later on in the opponents \
position.

 aclat 6k : yes :-) jan
 jansteen 3d*: Now two moves I think: q10 and k16 (variation "san
 ren-sei" and "nice shape").
 aclat 6k : k16 better than q10, which i played :<

 jansteen 3d*: But q10 is also terrific shape though

 jansteen 3d*: I tried to make the game small scale... However, white
doesn't have enough space to make a base here, so attacking seems
most natural thing to do.

Good move, preventing both r16 or s16.

This move aims at two follow-up shapes: s10, or s13. Both
shapes are hard to attack. In this position most normal way to play
for black seems variation "Attacking while building".

(

B[rf]
C[
This move seems too concerned with the upper-right corner.
The lower-right is bigger now. The black player shouldn't fear a white
move at r17, this will loose some territory, but weaken the outside
white group at the same time.
]
;
W[rg]
C[
White gets one of his follow-up shapes (one of r12's follow-ups).

;
B[re]
;
W[mg]
C[
White plays very thick again. Actually white could switch
somewhere else, since the group seems to be able to take care of itself.
However, when it is "extra-thick" it can be used to attack or as
back-up  for invasions around r6 for example.
]
;
B[pm]
C[
This move shows that black is worried about an invasion here. The
shape made with q7 is slightly "nurui" though. "Nurui" is  Japanese
Go jargon for a move which is "flesh nor fish". It tries to do two
things at the same time, but does both poorly/half. Better moves are
shown in variation "Hard to find" and "Hard to play".

Big move, black is right not to be too worried about p17,
black won't die there!

W[oc]
C[
Testing black's response. Depending on black's answer white
will decide what to do next.

B[pc]
C[
Good response, making the corner alive and all further moves
by white here gote (black doesn't need to respond them).
]
;
W[fe]
;
B[lb]
C[
Black is still worried about the p17 stone, but shouldn't
be. The corner is alive, so moving p17 is only endgame value. This
means however, that m18 is also only endgame value. Slightly small
in this stage.
]
;
W[cc]
C[
White doesn't answer m18 at l18 because black would ignore it.

Black could/should consider the other direction, variation "More
points".

Locally l18 is better (see the game later on). But there
is another point which has to be occupied first. It's in variation
"Taking keypoint" (but think first about which point).

This move is straight forward, seperating the white groups.

This move takes a firm grip on the corner and by strenghtening
it takes care "from a distance" of q10. I know it is hard to appreciate
this r5 move, but it really is a good move in such positions :-).
Just try to remember it.

This would increase the lower-right moyo, while attacking

could  also get the chance to play r5, the lower-right would become
a large  territory, almost enough to win the game.

This is simple and normal when white wants to settle quickly.

This variation is straight and simple: an exchange of territory
for power. Because of q10, k10, and q4, this works quite nicely for
black in this position. This sequence is a kind of joseki (corner
variation).

choose another direction

I mentioned this shape before, three hoshi stones in a row,

N[Splitting move]

This move seems most natural: split the white stones, and thus using
the black majority in the vicinity. There is no way to tell  what

 aclat 6k : but my fighting skill is poor :<
 aclat 6k : always try to avoid fighting with high dan

But I can imagine Sunny; however taking these challenges is the best way
to improve your game.

N[san ren-sei]

C[
 jansteen 3d*: how about this move, aclat? 
 aclat 6k : too far away? :-) 

This move builds up the upper-left side of the board, locally  ignoring
white. To create three hoshi (star, handicap) stones in  a row
(D16,  K16, and Q16) is very good shape. Professionals dream  about
this  kind of shape :-)
