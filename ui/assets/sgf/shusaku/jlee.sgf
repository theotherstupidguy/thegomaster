C[ Hi, Joongul Lee

I tried to give variations where ever I thought they might be useful.
I didn't restrict myself to comments on black moves only, because
sometimes a white move provided teaching material as well, ok?

Hope it's what you expected,

 a hane on three stones\).]

C[Good move again. Black plays the opening very well so far.
 The reason why q8 is a good move is: 1. it builds the top; 2. it \

induces  white "A", black "B", the latter move would slightly damage \

the marked  white stone \(as explained earlier\).]
