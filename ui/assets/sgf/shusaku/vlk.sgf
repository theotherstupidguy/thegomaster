Hi, I have just joined the go teach ladder and would like
you to review the attached game, please.
My igs name is vlk and I am white in the game. Thank you.

-- vlk

Sure, my pleasure. It became quite a lot of comments, partly
because I was fascinated by the fighting in this game. IGS
6k* is quite something! It's hard to point out general mistakes
because both of you played so well. So I concentrated on
specific variations and ideas. I hope I touched the right
strings in the comments.

;B[pd];W[pp];B[dd];W[co];B[nq]M[dd][pd]L[dq][qn]C[
More usual would be at [a\], since that's garanteed big.
When approaching the lower-right corner, the more usual side would
be [b\], because that would work better with the marked stones.
]
;W[jp]
;B[qn];W[pn]L[np]C[
Recently this move is played at [a\], see variation.
]
(
;Name[The game]
B[pm];W[on];B[qq];W[pq]L[qo]C[
Understandable, because all of white's stones are directed
to the left. However, still it might be better to block at [a\],
see variation.
]
(
;Name[The game]
B[pr];W[or];B[qr];W[oq];B[ro];W[cf];B[ci];W[cc];B[cd];W[bd]
L[dc][be]C[
More usual at [a\]. The move played in the game leaves black
the option to turn at [a\] instead of blocking at [b\].
]
;B[be];W[bc];B[ce];W[dc];B[ed];W[fc]M[fc]C[
Now we're back to a normal position locally. This result is
good for white because of two reasons:

 1. White's marked stone "hurts" the black hoshi stone at [Q16\].
 2. The black extension at c11 is not ideally placed, it's
low and too narrow.
]
;B[df]
;W[ck]L[dq]C[
Building a framework around the lower-left corner. This move
could also have been at [a\]. This move would ensure solid territory,
while also solifying the lower side.
]
;B[ei]M[df]L[cq]C[
This move is too small. Black makes the position too solid
here, especially considering that the marked stone has been played
as well. Probably best move here is to enter (3,3) in the lower-left,
at [a\].
]
;W[dq]C[
Good move, very big.
]
;B[cm]L[dr][eq][hq]
C[
Invading the less valuable side. The more valuable side is
the lower side. Invasion points are either [a\], [b\], or [c\].
]
;W[ek]L[bk][dl]C[
This leaves black the option to connect underneath (with
[a\]). White could consider to start an immediate fight with [b\]
instead. A stone at [b\] would make it harder to escape to the center
while also preventing the underneath connection.
]
;B[em];W[eo]L[gk]C[
Wrong direction. In a fight it's usual procedure to attack
from the weak side (at [a\]). The idea is that you attack while
strengthening your own weak group. Let's assume that you played
[a\],
 see variation.
]
(
;Name[The game]
B[bk];W[fm]L[qf][bj]C[
This move is not so big. The right side (at [a\]) looks
bigger now. Later you can aim at [b\], see variation.
]
(
;Name[The game]
B[el]C[
Usually it's bad to bump into the opponents stones like this.
The natural moves are either [a\] or [b\]. See variation.
]
(
;W[fl];B[fk];W[gk]L[hl][fj]C[
Better at [a\], because you would leave the option to play
at [b\] later on.
]
;B[fj];W[om]L[hl][gl]C[
Should be at [a\], because black can cut now with [b\].
Locally, it's better to play at [c\], see variation.
]
(
;Name[The game]
B[pl];W[qf]L[nk]C[
Usually white would add another move (at [a\]), again to
ahead of black here. The played move is also big though.
]
;B[qi]L[qh]C[
Could be even closer at [a\] because black is very strong
in the lower right corner.
]
;W[qc];B[qd];W[pc];B[oc]C[
A mistake, this move is not possible. Besides, there is nothing
wrong with the normal procedure, see variation.
]
(
;Name[The game]
W[od]L[rc]C[
Too early, the keypoint is [a\], see variation.
]
(
;Name[The game]
B[ob]C[
Black misses the keypoint ([a\]), see variation.
]
(
;Name[The game]
W[rd]M[od]C[
Right, now white will have a good result, whatever happens.
The marked white stone is a very severe cutting stone now.
]
;B[oe];W[nd];B[re];W[qe];B[pe];W[rc];B[rf];W[rg]
L[ne][nc]C[
A severe cut leading to a trade. White could also decide to
sacrifice the two white stones with [a\], and next capture the two
black stones with [b\], see variation.
]
(
;Name[The game]
B[qg]L[ne]C[
Better push first with [a\], black needs this stone.
]
;W[pf];B[ne];W[pg];B[qh];W[sf];B[rh]L[oh]C[
No hurry to play this move. Better to keep the white center
stones tight in liberties to aim at [a\] later on.
]
;W[se]
;B[md];W[ol]C[
Could be [a\] instead (see previous note on this move).
]
;B[nr]L[hc]C[
Black feels he has to invade. Blak [a\] is also very big though.
]
;W[os];B[kr];W[jr];B[kq]L[jq]C[
Black [a\] instead would lead to very complicated fighting.
]
;W[jq]
;B[lo];W[kn]L[lm]C[
Seems to contain black. However, the safe way to attack might
be with [a\] (remember about attacking from the weak side). When
white [a\], I estimate a 75% chance that black will die.
]
;B[ln];W[lm];B[mm];W[ml]C[
Consequently played, but very dangerous as well!
]
;B[ko]C[
Good timing, pushing before cutting.
]
;W[jn];B[jo]
;W[io];B[km];W[ll];B[in];W[jm];B[im]L[jl][kl]C[
Not necessary, so shouldn't play this move. It spoils the
options to play at [a\] or [b\] later on.
]
;W[jl];B[ho]
C[
Black can live by playing as in the variation.

;W[gr];B[fq];W[fr];B[kp];W[eq];B[mq];W[ns]L[qo][rn]C[
Without the [a\], [b\] exchange white can't kill here, so  best is
to play this move now.
]
;B[ms]
;W[ls];B[lr]C[
Black can live with [a\].
]
;W[mr];B[ir]C[
Better throw in first.
]
;W[gq];B[ms];W[qp];B[rp];W[mr];B[fn]
L[no]C[
Black [a\] instead would make things very complicated.
]
;W[ms];B[gm];W[np]C[
Not necessary I believe.
]
;B[hc]L[eb]C[
Big, as this move is also aiming the follow-up at [a\].
]
;W[fd];B[eb]L[fb]C[
A more subtle move would be [a\], but it's about the same.
]
;W[ec]
;B[fb];W[ff]C[
Greedy, best is to live now with [a\], see variation.
]
(
;Name[The game]
B[ge];W[fe];B[db]C[
Now white is dead locally, so he has to find an eye in the  center.
]
;W[bf]L[he]C[
Probably white [a\] will give you the best chances.
]
;B[dg];W[ae];B[hf];W[bh]C[
Too direct, better try something like [a\], see variation.

compensation. Pity, you played a good game.

N[Keep the aji]
AE[bh];W[hg]C[
This move aims something...
]
;B[ig];W[fh]L[gf][he][hh]C[
Aiming [a\], [b\], [c\].
]
;B[hh];W[de];B[ee]
;W[ef];B[de];W[dh]C[
This will lead to defeat for black.

White lives, because...
]
;B[ca];W[da];B[ba];W[ad];B[ab]C[
This is seki at best.

N[Seeking life]
AE[ho];B[ip];W[ho];B[hp];W[gp]C[
Necessary to save the three white stones.
]
;B[go];W[hn];B[gq];W[fp];B[hq]
;W[is];B[kp]M[ip][hp][hq][gq]C[
Black's strategy here is to sacrifice the marked stones while
seeking life for the group on the right.
]
;W[fq];B[ks];W[gr];B[mp]
L[no][mn][oo][po][op]C[
Black lives, because he can make another eye with [a\], [b\],
[c\], [d\], [e\].
]

)
(
;
N[Sacrifice]
AE[rg];W[ne];B[pg];W[nf];B[og];W[nc]L[nb][rg]C[
Later (when white would get a stone at [a\]), white can
aim the big endgame move at [b\].
]
)
)
(
;
N[The keypoint (again)]
AE[ob];B[rc]L[nc]C[
This move is a hane on two stones, and besides it defends
against [a\]. Whatever happens, black will be ok in this fight.
]
)
)
(
;
N[The keypoint]
AE[od];W[rc];B[rd];W[od]M[pd][qd][rd][qf]C[
Now the cut is good, black's marked stones are in deep trouble
because the white marked stone is at their vital point. Black will
loose either these stones or the stone at [P17\].
]
)
)
(
;
N[Normal procedure.]
AE[oc];B[od];W[rd];B[re];W[rc];B[qe];W[nc]C[
This is the normal procedure. Probably black will continue with...
]
;B[me];W[mc];B[nk]
C[
Taking this point feels good because it's the borderline between
two frameworks.
]
)
)
(
;
N[Locally better]
AE[om];W[nl]L[pl]C[
The diffence with the game is that you're ahead of black now
(instead of pusinh from behind). Black will probably defend the
weakness at [a\] by playing there himself.
]
)
)
(
;
N[More natural]
AE[el];B[fl]M[ek][ck]C[
When black plays hane white will most likely cut to work with
his marked stones.
]
;W[el];B[fn];W[gm]L[dm]C[
White can connect with [a\], but allowing a ponnuki is bad
because it will damage the lower side too much.
]
;B[en];W[gk]
;B[cl]M[en][fn]L[bj]C[
This sequence seems expectable. Black is happy because the
marked stones damage the lower side, and the aji of white [a\]
is gone as well.
]
)
)
(
;
N[Aji left]
AE[fm];W[bj];B[cj];W[bl];B[dk];W[cl];B[dl];W[bm]L[bi][bh]
C[
This is big. You should not play this sequence too early however
because black gets very thick in the center. Also note that you
shouldn't play [a\] for [b\] in this position because...
]
;W[bi];B[bh];B[ak]M[bi][bj]L[al][bn]C[
Black will have this tesuji to cut off the two marked stones.
When you would play [a\] (to save them), you die after [b\].
]
)
)
(
;
N[Attack from the strong side]
AE[eo];W[gk];B[bk]L[dl]C[
If black connects underneath now you can still create difficulties
with [a\], for example...
]
;W[dl];B[dm];W[bj];B[bl];W[cj];B[bi]
;W[ai];B[ah];W[aj];B[eo];W[fp];B[gm];W[il]M[fp]L[bh][hk]
C[
The marked black group is still not save. White created the
cut at [a\], and took territory with the marked stone, while building
up center influence with [J8\]. When black lives however, he will
look for a chance to cut at [b\].
]
)
)
(
;
N[Natural flow]
AE[pq];W[qo];B[pq];W[rn]M[pd][dd]L[lq][or]C[
White becomes thick, which will make it hard for black to
turn the two marked stones into a moyo (framework). Meanwhile, white
can later aim at the nice point of [a\] which in turn aims at [b\].
]
)
)
(
;
N[Recent developments]
AE[pn];W[np]C[
Many different options here for black, but I will show one
as an example.
]
;B[mp];W[no];B[qq];W[oq];B[qp];W[nr]M[qn]C[
The white position has become thick which works nicely with
the lower-left position. Black might be slightly unhappy about the
strong position (marked stone) facing his own influence-oriented
hoshi stone at [Q16\].
