and asking the opponent about his real Go strength :-\).]

along the other part of the board.]

"A" feels slightly submissive, "B" is the game.]

C[Now you see the reason why p10 was bad, white can capture
one stone, and the center aji "A" is gone for black. Now, white is
better, if black would have played k6 without the marked exchange,
black would be ok, or even better.]

C[The largest point. The rest of the game could still have brought
black victory, but Kishiko missed some chances unfortunately.]
