Comment[ Usually it's a bad  idea to play kosumi tsuke when white \
can extend along the edge. The  normal move is at A. The reason is \
that you loose the option to attack  white because you make him strong.]

Comment[ This extension is too wide.  White can be satisfied with \
the normal moves here: either A or B.]
Letter[qj][pj]
;
Black[qn]
Comment[ Maybe just making san-rensei \(with A\) is bigger. But anyway
 this move emphasises the thinness of white's position on the right.
 A move at B is an option now.]

Comment[This move is ok considering this is a handicap game.]

Black[fq]
Comment[Bad, black won't gain a lot while white will get stronger.]
;
White[cf]
Comment[White should play either A or B, these moves are too big to
 let go by. Black could take quite a lot of profit now by playing \
either  of these moves.]
Letter[fp][gq]

White[fd]
Comment[ Because the marked stone  is in a low position settling along \
the upper edge is not really valuable  here. Besides, white has a \
number of weak groups already, so simply  entering san-san \(3,3\) \
point is better here.]

Comment[This move is a bit simple for black. It will be obvious what \
will be his response, and you won't get much stronger by it. Maybe \
trying to settle along the upper edge with either A or B is more interesting. \
You can aim at C later on.]
White[ej]

Comment[You just strengthened this group in the center so it is not \
in need for eye space. Aiming san-san is more interesting. But again, \
settling the upper edge is urgent.]

Comment[The problem of this move is that it gives away territory. \
So you have to be sure that your attack on the upper left will be \
serious as well. A cheap alternative is the move at A. This also aims \
the attack and besides prepares for either follow up move B or C.]
