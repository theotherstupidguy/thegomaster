"b". Also "c", to settle immediately would be an option of course.]

 jlee: I didn't feel like playing p17 because of k16.

 jansteen: Very good!
That would have given white perfect shape: see "perfect shape". By
the way, you don't *need* to respond in the upper-right area. You
could also make a shimari with "a" for example.

C[Of course, now white also occupies this point, but the white
shape along the upper-edge is still subject to invasions.
]

B[cf];
W[qc]
C[First of all, white spends many moves here. In the opening
it's important to avoid this. Next, this move probably is not good
because white has a problem making shape, after black responded normally.

C[
 Question: Is this good?

 Answer: Compared to a move on the 4th line, this
move leaves more space for invading. The virtue of a higher move could 
be to have some effect in the center or along the right edge, but
not in this position, so it's not a good move. It is hard to find
a better move though. For example: "a" would make the marked stone
inefficient. Maybe \(I'm not sure\) white should try to play like
in "seeking efficiency"

C[Good, the wider side is more valuable. Suddenly the lower-right
seems to turn into a moyo.

C[An alternative which you should always consider after being
pincered is to enter san-san \(3,3\) with "a". Like in most positions,
it is feasible here as well.

B[fo];
W[dn];
L[jp][dq][cq][cr]
C[The first bad move by black. Better to play "A" and leave
the corner open for later. Either you can make eye-shape with "B",
"C", "D", or you can invade with "C". Go technically speaken, this
move is aji-keshi, it erases other good options.
]
B[dr]
;
L[cq]
C[White decides that the lower-edge is bigger than defending
the corner but since black "A" is annoying I would probably play
it  myself now.
]
W[kp];
C[White had two weak groups inside black's moyo now. Black is
doing fine in this opening.
]
B[cq];
C[It's not easy to find a move for white along the left side,
although I feel that's more urgent than invading the right corner.
]
W[pq];
C[Good idea, seperating white's groups.]
B[oq];
L[or]
C[Vulgar style, normal would be "A". The reason is that white
bumps with his "head" into the black stone at Q5. This means that
this chain will have problems because of lack of liberties later on.
]
W[pp];
B[op];
W[qo];
C[Good. This move uses the fact that the Q4 chain lacks liberties.]
B[qn];
W[pn];
B[oo];
W[ro];
B[rn];

L[ql]
C[Just jumping to "a" is good enough here. White still needs
to come back to the corner \(once\) so you'll gain a tempo in the
fight later on.

C[White settles for a deal here, good choice.]

C[jlee: I thought the result was ok for me because I got the corner
in sente.

 jansteen: True, black's corner is reasonably big, but the fight would
have been more interesting, especially since you have the marked stones
to help you.
]
;
L[dk][dj]
C[I'd prefer to play high with "a" or "b". First of all to maintain
balance with the marked stone. Next, to make the gap to the center
smaller. Please notice that now two black stones peep under the white
position: C3 and C8, this shows inefficiency.

C[Not to the point, better to seperate the two white groups
around "a". A move around that point weakens two groups.

 Question: Is it time to do something like f16?

 Answer: No, probably not. Once white played
j17, f16 \(and later g17 to capture f17\) is rather small.

C[
 Question: Is this too small?

 Answer: The balance of power in the center demands
you to play "a". With "a" you can aim to cut white with "b", so it
gives you good prospects, while keeping your positions strong.
Please notice that you use three stones to capture f17, so it's
a rather small gain.

 jlee: At this point I felt pressure.
 It looked like a close game, if not losing.

 jansteen: I can only give one advise: when the game suddenly looks
bad for you, stay calm and play thick (strong positions). You will
almost for sure get another chance to get back into the game later on.
