C[Personally, I will play q5, r6 or maybe q6, as next move B q5 is to good
for black.

Yes, I agree with your comment.]
;B[po];W[qf]
C[This is another move with I strongly disagree with. W r10 shld be the
*ONLY* move. :-)

Yes, again you're right.]

C[Q1: I think W k17 is wrong. Shld be W q13 B r15 W o13 B n14 W l17. M I
rite? 

White's move is ok. The marked white stone has quite a lot of aji.]

M[qf];B[cc]
C[Q2: I think I shld have cut at B n17. Shld I?

No, you shouldn't cut there, no need.The invasion at c17 is ok, very big.]

;W[cf];B[qe]
C[Q3: I think this is a weak move. Any better move for B r16?

This move is good, preventing white to cut at 'a'. Normally you would
answer 'a' with 'b', but now white became strong in the upper-left he
would build a big moyo by pushing further with 'c'.]

L[od][pe][oe];W[oj];B[ok]
C[This move is usually played at 'a'. Since you are touching the weak stone
it will get stronger, making it harder for you to attack.]

L[pl];W[pj];B[pk];W[qi];B[qk]
C[Q4: Is B s11 better?

No, white would just capture one stone in that case. That would make it
too simple for white to live.]
;W[ph];B[nj]
C[Black 'a', preventing white at that point is a good move here. When white
ansers with \[o10\] you are happy to play 'b' building up your lower right
moyo.]

L[pf][ml];W[ni];B[mi];W[nh];B[mj];W[kq];B[lp]
C[Q5: Any better move for B m4? I m thinking of B k3 but dun know the follow-up
after W l4.

Right, k3 is normal, preventing 'a'. The continuation is something like
in the variation.
 The problem of your move is that white can easily live along the bottom.]
(
;W[lq];B[kp];W[nq]
C[White 'a' is better.]

L[ir];B[np]
C[Q6: Is B n4 better?

Black 'a' is better. Use the strength above to receive white's group when
it moves towards the center. Don't try to build territory between two
walls.]

L[jq];W[or];B[pr];W[jq];B[jp];W[mr]
C[Q7: Is this neccessary? Isn't j3 or h2 better?

White \[n2\] is slow, better at 'a' aiming 'b' next.]

L[hr][gp];
L[hj][gn][ij]B[lg]
C[Q8: I think this is a wrong move, although I m aiming for B s12. I shld
have played g7. Am I correct?

When I would play here, I would go for 'a'. But the question which move
is best is very, very hard to answer.
 Your proposal to play around 'b', white would play 'c'.]
;W[re];
L[pf]
C[Better at 'a'.]
B[rd];W[pe];B[qd];
L[ij][il]W[kl]
C[Q9: May I know the strongest way of handling this move. I think W l8 is
really too deep...

White should have played a move which both reduces and builds his own
moyo. Maybe something like 'a'. Your best counter now is probably 'b'.
While attacking you will build strength to do damage to the left side
white position.]
;
L[mc][lc][mb]B[og]
C[Q10: Is this move too early? Shld I make preparation at n15 first?

Instead of \[n15\] maybe this is a nice moment to cut at 'a'. When which
answers 'b', you descend to 'c' and the outside sente moves make the white
group really weak. When white answers 'c', you play as in the diagram.]

C[Q11: This is a bad move, isn't it? White can play n15, rite?

Rite.]
;W[lc]
C[Q12: I expected this move but W n15 maybe disastrous for me, rite?

Right, n15 is annoying.]
;B[me];W[mc];B[il]

Yes, it's good.]

B[ij];W[kh];B[hh];W[kg];
L[cl]B[cq]
C[Q15: Shld this move be played in the centre? Say B l14 or Bj14?

No, that's not necessary. But how about invade at 'a', instead of (3,3).
Anyway, your invasion is the right direction, invade and destroy territory.]

L[em][dm][ek][gm]B[hg]
C[Q16: Weak move again, *sigh*, B g13 better rite?

Yes, locally \[g13\] is better, but I would propose 'a', white 'b', black
'c'. If you don't play there, white can take 'd' and make territory.]
;W[gg];B[hf];W[lf];
L[em]B[gf]
C[Q17: Connect at B m15 better? Or B g8 (which I overlook) better?

Locally, your move is better than \[m13\]. But still 'a' is biggest.]
