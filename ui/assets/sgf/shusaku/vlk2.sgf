Hi again. Here is another game I would like reviewed. I play
white and thought I had an early lead, but then found myself ten
points behind, and only won it back through my opponents blunder.
My big question is with the opening.
I felt he made some mistakes that I failed to take advantage of.
It started out as a moyo game ... or so it looked to be, and I
am always nervous with those. So, you can restrict your commentary
to the beginning of the game mostly, since that is what I am really
interested in. Thanks.

Hi,

When I replayed this game I noticed that both of you missed the
keypoints in the center a few times. In this kind of moyo oriented
games the center power is all deciding. The player who controls the
center controls the game. Please remember that in the next moyo game
and you will do much better. Good luck.

Jan van der Steen.

;B[pd];W[pp];B[dd];W[co]M[dd]L[cj]C[
A usual way to try to discourage black from building a moyo along
the upper edge. The reason is that the marked black stone doesn't
feel to develop anymore in the direction of 'a', since white [c5\]
is very solid towards that direction.
]
;B[nq]M[pd]L[dq][qn]
C[
This move at 'a' is definitely big as well. When approaching the
lower right hoshi stone, the move at 'b' seems more natural because
it's both a kakari and an extension of the marked stone in the
upper right.
]
;W[jq]M[jq][co]L[eq][cq][hq]C[
When white creates the marked shape, he should realise that black
can invade later on at 'a', making miai of 'b' or 'c' next.
]
;B[qn];W[pn]C[
Always hard which side to play. White usually will play on the
stronger stone to attack the weaker one later on. That would suggest
the move played.
]
;B[pm];W[on]
;B[qq];W[qo];B[qm];W[pq];B[pr];W[or]L[rn][rr]
C[
This is not so good for white. Correct moves are either 'a' (diagram
1) or 'b' (diagram 2).
]
(
;B[qr];W[oq];B[ro]M[nq]L[nr]C[
This is not so good because black's stones work very efficiently
here. Besides, white's territory is still very open, so the marked
black stone will still be able to move (starting with 'a' for example).
]
;W[dq]M[nq]L[om]C[
The keypoint for power is 'a'. That point would flatten black and
give white's moyo more body. Besides, it would make moving the
marked black stone less attractive.
]
;B[jd]L[om]C[
Likewise, black's keypoint here is 'a'.
]
;W[om]
C[
Good.
]
;B[ol];W[nl];B[nk]L[ok][pl][oj]C[
Unnecessarily forceful. It allows white to start a fight with 'a',
'b', 'c'. Usual shape here would be just 'a'.
]
;W[mk]L[ml][ok][pl][oj]
C[
Better shape is stretching to 'a'. When black would defend 'b'
next, then white has sente. When black keeps on pushing, white
cuts at 'b', black 'c', and fights with 'd'.
]
;B[ml];W[nm];B[nj]L[mj][ni][ok]C[
Bad shape because a white push at 'a' is sente again (because of
'b'). Better shape is 'c'.
]
;W[ll]L[mj][qf][re][qc]
C[
Better push at 'a' and keep on pushing once or twice more. Next
invade at 'b', 'c' or 'd' as you like.
]
;B[mj]C[
Right, black's moyo looks better than white's suddenly.
]
;W[mm]L[lk]C[
Better connect at 'a', that stone would be more useful later on
while fighting inside the black moyo.
]
;B[qg]L[qc][qe][qi][og][mg]C[
Not good because it leaves the invasion at 'a'. A much better point
to protect the side is 'b' (double purpose). When white would invade
next at [r13\] black would fight with 'c', white 'd', black 'e'.
]
;W[lj]
M[mm]L[lk]C[
Here you see another reason why the marked stone should have been
at 'a': this hane would have been more powerful in that case.
]
;B[cj]L[li]C[
Black should play at 'a', the keypoint for center power.
]
;W[lh]C[
Very good!
]
;B[kk]L[li][kj][kh]C[
Probably not good because black looses the aji at 'a' (aiming to
cut either at 'b' or 'c' next.
]
;W[kj]
L[li][ki][mi][kh]C[
White should just connect. When black would play 'a' next, then
white would play 'b', black 'c', white 'd'. This fight is ok for
white because a black cut at [l10\] would be gote (not atari).
]
;B[jk]L[lk]C[
Making the kikashi stone heavy which is bad because it can't be
sacrificed anymore like that. Better to either cut at 'a' (consequent,
but slightly overplay), or leave the scene completely by invading
somewhere at the bottom for example.
]
;W[dk]M[kk][jk]L[lk]
C[
Just connecting at 'a' is more than enough here. This would make
the two marked black stones useless.
]
;B[lk]C[
Black cuts in sente. This turns the tables in the center quite
a bit. Suddenly it's a fair fight.
]
;W[ml];B[jj];W[ji]L[jh]C[
Better shape would be 'a'. Now black can play 'a' himself, putting
white in serious trouble.
]
;B[ii];W[jh];B[hj];W[ih];B[hh]
;W[mi]L[ok][nh][ph][qh]C[
This uses the aji at 'a' too soon maybe. For example, maybe later
on white would prefer to have this stone at 'b' (also sente) instead.
Or, when the white group would live later on white would prefer
to use the aji to start trouble with 'c', or 'd'.
]
;B[oi]L[pk]C[
Better on 'a' I think.
]
;W[ik]L[ij][hg]
C[
This is a bad move. When black answers with 'a', white 'b' lost
impact on black's shape.
]
;B[hk]C[
Difficult, probably also ok.
]
;W[il]C[
Too heavy and aji keshi as well.
]
;B[ij];W[jm];B[ck];W[dl];B[bm]L[dj]C[
A move at 'a' seems more important.
]
;W[cl]L[dj][cm][bl]
C[
Bad, better push at 'a'. Omitting white [c8\] would leave a move
at 'b' or 'c' for later.
]
;B[bl];W[qc];B[pc];W[qd];B[qe];W[re];B[rf];W[pe];B[qf];W[pb]
;B[ob];W[qb];B[nc];W[sd];B[gm]L[jf][if]C[
After having invaded at (3,3) an attack starting with 'a' or 'b'
looks serious now.
]
;W[hl]L[gl]C[
The same comments as for [c8\]. This move is bad style, you spoil
the better style move at 'a'.
]
;B[gl]
;W[gi]L[fk][fh][ch][hg][ke]C[
White is loosing here. Maybe peep at 'a' and 'b' next (making miai
of 'c' and 'd') would make your opponent nervous. When black answers
at 'd', you play kikashi at 'e' to strengthen this group and aim
to play 'c'.
]
;B[fj];W[hn];B[fn];W[go]
;B[fo];W[fp];B[dn];W[dj];B[di];W[cn];B[cm];W[do];B[eo];W[ep]
;B[cc]C[
Now black is definitely better.

(
;
N[Diagram 1]
AE[or];W[rn]L[or]C[
This move prevents the underneath connection, so the threat is
'a' next.
]
;B[rr];W[rm]C[
White's compensation for loosing the corner territory is that the
three marked stones are seriously weakened by white's last move.
]
;B[qk]L[pk]C[
If at 'a', white will take away their base with [r9\].
]
;W[pk]L[om][ql]
C[
Vital point. Next, if black 'a', then white 'b'.
]
;B[pj];W[ql];B[pl];W[ok];B[rl];W[om];B[qh]L[qj]C[
Necessary to defend the cut at 'a'. This pattern is a kind of joseki.
]
)
(
;
N[Diagram 2]
AE[or];W[rr];B[qr];W[rq]L[or][qp]C[
These stones can not be cut because of white's option to play 'a'
when the liberty at 'b' gets filled in.
]
;B[lq]L[om]C[
The balance between the two groups is delicate. Probably white
will continue next with 'a'.
