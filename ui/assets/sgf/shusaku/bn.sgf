C[I hope the comments will be of any use. I would especially
like to stress two concepts:

 1. kikashi    \(forcing move\)
 2. karui/omoi \(light/heavy\)

I am convinced that if you grasp what I'm talking about in the various
comments that you will become at least one stone stronger for each
of the two concepts discussed \(no kidding\). ]

C[The black constellation is one of the most popular beside
san-ren-sei \(three hoshi stones in a row\). White can deal with this
opening type in two ways:

 1. invade the upper edge (a)
 2. build a constellation himself (b).

Nowadays, professionals choose for the invasion at (a). In the Edo
era \(Honinbo Shusaku\) and even still in the beginning of this
century \(Go Seigen\), the move at (b) was seen too frequently.

Please refer to the variation for the normal procedure in this position.

L[ed][co]

;
L[lc][fc][ed]
C[Although unusual, this move can't be bad. This stone will
extend to either (a) or (b) and thus settle itself conveniently.
Establishing a save group here prevents black from creating a moyo
\(potential territory\).

However, most contemporary professionals play the kakari at (c)
instead, so probably they consider this move a little slow. ]
W[ic]
;
B[kc]
;
L[ec][gc]
C[This seems a normal move. It would also have been possible
to play at (a), although this may lead to immediate fighting after
black (b). ]
W[fc]
;
C[The normal answer to white's marked move (f17) would be
(a). Although it is a rather small shimari it is a very efficient
move combines three purposes:

 1. making territory
 2. attacking the white group
 3. prevents being enclosed like with (b) \(see variation\)

These kind of multi-purpose moves are most important in Go. ]

C[An interesting move. Black takes this important point and
lets the three stones on the left edge fight for themselves. ]
B[dc]
;
L[dk][dj][di]
C[It's obvious that since black played tenuki, white should
consider an attacking move somewhere in this neighbourhood. The moves
which seem candidates are: (a), (b), (c) and the move actually
played \((C11)\).

In my opinion it takes a professional to be able to decide what is
the best way to proceed in this position. Therefore I looked up the
position in my Go game database and was lucky to find a professional
game containing exactly this position \(see variation\). \(By the
way, the database hit also tells us that this position still satisfies
professional standards :\). ]
W[ci]
(
;
L[ck][cf]
C[Black could decide to make a small extension to (a) \(for
white (b)\). Playing the pincer at (C13) shows good spirit. ]
B[cg]
;
L[ei][ck][dk]
C[One should feel a little reluctant to play right in the direction
of the three black stones. I would like to give some alternatives:

The first idea is to jump right into the centre with (a). I have
always been taught by my \(patient\) sensei that while being attacked
ikken-tobi should be the first move to consider.

Another idea is to play (b), keeping a little distance from the
black stones. This move makes good shape to create eyes if necessary
while also preventing that black occupies this point creating some
eye space for himself.

The final move to consider is (c), a move which is lighter than
(b). It also keeps some distance from the black stones, but has
the additional feature that it moves to the centre more rapidly. ]
W[cl]
;
L[op][qj]
C[It's hard to agree with this move. First of all it's not urgent
to play here. Next, it shifts from the actual battle field \(lower-left\).
And finally, it's not the largest move either \(black (a) or (b)
would be larger\). ]
B[ke]
;
C[A relaxed and good answer. Strengthening the white group indirectly
helps white on the left side, and provides backup strength for actions
in the upper-right corner later on. But meanwhile realise that this
doesn't imply that actions in the upper-right corner should be sought,
they even might never happen. ]
W[ie]
;
L[go][gn][bj]
C[A bad move since it will strengthen the rather weak white
group. The normal direction of movement after white (C8) would be
to jump to the centre with (a) or (b). After having jumped black
could seek the opportunity to attack the group \(by removing the eyes
with (c) for example\).]
B[dk]

W[dl]
;
B[el]
;
L[bn][ek]
C[My first reaction when I saw this move was: "strange, can't
be a good move in any sense" \(sorry Jim :\). But, once I started
to think of it, it *does* have some interesting features. First of
all it connects the two stones with the stone at (C11). Next, it
intends to connect with (a). And finally, it prepares for the cut
at (b). ]
W[bm]
;
L[bn]
C[Black can hardly fight with (a). White will play (e7)
and the black group will be weaker than the white group, making the
fight unreasonable.]
B[em]
;
C[This result is not bad for white since he got rid of the weak
group by connecting it, enlarging his corner territory in the mean
time, and the black group in the centre is not thickness \(although
not really weak either\). ]
W[bn]

B[di]

C[A big move. ]
W[qj]

L[oq][op]
C[Preventing a shimari with either (a) or (b) might be bigger.

B[lq]
;
L[nq][pq]
C[Good, no need for (a) which would leave corner weaknesses
at (b) and (P3). ]
W[oq]
;
L[qh][ql]
C[A move at (a) seems larger: it extends the moyo and prepares
an invasion at (b). Black shouldn't worry too much about the stone
at (M3). The stone is quite difficult to attack efficiently. Another
reason to prefer (a) instead of (J3) is that the latter move doesn't
have any effects on white's position on the left since the white corner
is extremely solid. ]
B[iq]
;
L[qd][qc][pb][mc]
C[This move is very large since it also helps white when black
would decide to enter white's right side. Besides, it will help white
to invade the black moyo in the upper-right. Moves like (a), (b),
(c) and (d) are possible ways to start the invasion. ]

C[Normally a kikashi, but in this position \(with W(b6)\)
it's not, strictly spoken. ]
B[ep]

Playing tenuki would enable white to choose between the three possibilities
at a more appropriate moment in the game. ]

still is some cutting potential left in the position \(starting with
white (a)\). ]

C[The weak spot in white's shape. ]

C[The move actually played in the game \(W(n4)\) will most
likely hurt the white position more than the black one. It moves with
the wrong stone.

Jim, did you consider white (a) instead \(see the variation\). ]
W[mp]
L[on]
(
;
B[nq]
C[The tremendous advantage which black has in this fight is
that black has one weak group \((o3),(o4)\) while white has two
\((n4)-(n5) and (p3)\). The black stone at (m3) is not weak
since it's light, i.e. not a lot of damage imposed on black in the
event that it would be captured by white. ]
;
W[op]
C[One should be reluctant to play this move since it invites
black to play the perfect splitting move at (o5). But things already
run out of control in this position. ]
;
B[no]

W[mq]

B[or]
C[Why not block at (a) instead? Black (a) would virtually
connect all black stones, leaving the three white stones \((n3)-(n5)\)
heavy \(i.e. without purpose\).]
L[mr]

W[mr]
C[Good, destroys all relationship between the two black positions.
Black should definitely have played there himself with his previous
move \(no matter what happens\). ]
;
B[oo]
;
W[qq]
C[Why not cut at (a) Jim? Once white is connected, the black
stones will immediately look heavy since they will have no attacking
aim anymore. ]
L[nr]
;
B[nr]
C[Once black played here, both the white corner and the (n2)-(n5)
group look heavy. ]
;
W[pm]
C[Wrong direction and bad shape.

The direction is wrong since the left group is weaker than the corner.
So maybe white (a) or (b) instead would be better. Remember: always
play from the weaker group \(and if it's too weak just try to find
an appropriate way to get rid of it \).

The shape is bad since black can play (c) later on. Better shape
would have been (d). ]
L[mn][mm][qo][pn]
;
B[mn]
C[Black strengthens his group while attacking white. ]
;
W[ko]
C[Because of white (q7), the direction of play is moving to
the black stones on the left. This is not what white wants. ]
;
B[lr]
C[Hum... this move makes the black stone at (m3) heavy again,
there should be a good reason for doing so. One way to justify this
decision is that black is aiming to kill the white group. The normal
move in this position would be (a) \(see the variation\). ]
L[ln]
(

W[ln]

B[lp]
C[Black (a) seems more efficient. After black (a), black
can later still play (m4). If white plays there, black can give
atari with (b). ]
