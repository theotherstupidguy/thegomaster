 jansteen 3d*:  Relaxed opening
]
;W[ce]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  c15 seems unusual
 imp NR : as is d6 :)
]
;B[pj]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  Now black's shape is perfect
 imp NR : now k17 around
 jansteen 3d*:  Yes, k17 direction anyway
]
;W[nc]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  Next move?
 imp NR : k16:)
 imp NR : hi malf:)
 jansteen 3d*:  l16 is old-fashion according to Michael Redmond :)
 jansteen 3d*:  Hi malf
 imp NR : flippo here:)
 jansteen 3d*:  k16 is possible, but also lacks some modern severity
 imp NR : also here
 imp NR : hi:)
 imp NR : m16 ever played?
 jansteen 3d*:  m16 is possible (I've seen it before)
 jansteen 3d*:  White will probably jump, and next slide twice
 imp NR : also old-fashioned tsuke-nobi possible of course (o16)
 jansteen 3d*:  If you like to play o16 direction then p15 is modern :)
 imp NR : oh yea:)
 jansteen 3d*:  q14 is boring (sorry malf :)
 imp NR : finally, o15 exists:)
 jansteen 3d*:  Yah, o15 possible, but...
 jansteen 3d*:  The top is also valuable...
 jansteen 3d*:  So, what then?!
 jansteen 3d*:  Combine top and aspiration to build moyo
 imp NR : n16?
 jansteen 3d*:  n16 is possible, sure
 jansteen 3d*:  Yes, PURPLE (and flippo), that's the move
]
;B[lc]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  Maybe someone mentioned it before but I'm working on an old-fashion monitor tonight
 jansteen 3d*:  I don't see a thing here :)
 imp NR : :)
 jansteen 3d*:  so I might miss a few comments of you
 imp NR : a stamp:)

 jansteen 3d*:  Next move (idea?)
 jansteen 3d*:  Hi HP
 zli 8k*: o3
 imp NR : o3 (flippo)
 jansteen 3d*:  flippo: what's more valuable: left or right side of q4?
 imp NR : richt side
 jansteen 3d*:  Right
 imp NR : :)
 jansteen 3d*:  So what to play?
 imp NR : r6:)
 jansteen 3d*:  HP got it

;W[ql]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  Next move is new to me
 jansteen 3d*:  What's the usual idea here?
 imp NR : r10 (flippo) ?
 jansteen 3d*:  Yes, r9, r10 or s9
 jansteen 3d*:  However, look at the s17 stone....
 zli 8k*: s10
 jansteen 3d*:  Black open in upper right, so r9 et cetera only worth half the value
 imp NR : o16 a move?
 imp NR : o6, sorry
 jansteen 3d*:  So, black invites white to slide to s10 making this stone and s17 overlap their function
 imp NR : i like p9:)
 jansteen 3d*:  And then we notice that HP again got it :)
]
;B[ok]C[
 imp NR : will be back to 3d* soon:)
]
;W[rj]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  But then the next move is completely contrary to the little story we just made up...
]
;B[ri]C[
 imp NR : well, b does not mind w r11 now:)
 jansteen 3d*:  That's right imp
 jansteen 3d*:  That's probably the idea here
]
;W[qj]
;B[qi]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  Right malf, but think again
 jansteen 3d*:  The next move is discussed in the excellent book: "the fundamentals of Go"
 imp NR : o17 less ambitios, but maybe cut now overplay
 imp NR : o7 sorry
 jansteen 3d*:  O7 looks similar to o6
 imp NR : may i look it up? :))
 jansteen 3d*:  sure :)
 jansteen 3d*:  Look in chapter defense (i think)
 imp NR : which page? :)
 jansteen 3d*:  n7 wild :)
 jansteen 3d*:  I don't know the page, just remember the shape
 jansteen 3d*:  n7 looks not like the move, it's too thin
 jansteen 3d*:  Sure malf, running is the correct idea here
 imp NR : o8 then
 jansteen 3d*:  Just the shape now
 jansteen 3d*:  Yes, o8!

;W[nl]C[
 imp NR : thx HP:)
 imp NR : :)

;B[ol]
;W[om]
;B[ro]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  Black weakens white's group while defending against r3
]
;W[pi]
;B[oi]
;W[ph]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  These white cutting stones give white aji in this area

;W[mj]
;B[oh]
;W[mm]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  So black got the corner and white managed to flatten b's top center somewhat
 jansteen 3d*:  Next move?
 jansteen 3d*:  I think this result is about even
 jansteen 3d*:  Left side is valuable, but a move there has one meaning
 jansteen 3d*:  Black played another valuable move with *two* meanings
 jansteen 3d*:  For black it's hard to build territory at the top because of m18 weakness
 jansteen 3d*:  Yes levner, m6 is the right spirit
 imp NR : m8 to attack?
]
;B[lp]C[
 imp NR : preparation?
 jansteen 3d*:  Nothing spectacular, but strengthening the bottom while weakening white's center group
 jansteen 3d*:  right imp
 jansteen 3d*:  Of course now white plays...?
 imp NR : k4?
 c24 4k*:  well
 imp NR : is g3 too much of an overplay?
 jansteen 3d*:  If white would defend the center group he would fall behind in territory when black would play c10
 imp NR : oh, on left side of course:)
 jansteen 3d*:  g3 is dangerous with the other weak group in the center
 jansteen 3d*:  right imp
 jansteen 3d*:  Which point ?
 imp NR : d9 or c10
 jansteen 3d*:  in between :)
]

 imp NR : oh no:(
 imp NR : typo?

;W[co]
;B[br]
;W[ap]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  Now black defended *in sente* the g3 weakness and can go ahead elsewhere, where? :)
 jansteen 3d*:  Very good HP!
 imp NR : attack the center group that w failed to defend:)

;B[df]C[
 imp NR : wow HP:)

;W[gd]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  Next move?
 imp NR : d7 an idea?
 jansteen 3d*:  d10 seems general concensus
 jansteen 3d*:  It's the right direction
 iplr 17k :  e9?
 jansteen 3d*:  But let me ask: if white to move here, where would he play?
 imp NR : e9 nicer?
 jansteen 3d*:  c12 and let black split with c14, no
 imp NR : but c14 so slow now...
 jansteen 3d*:  Yes, c14 is one way, but not suji
 jansteen 3d*:  Right tiger, that's normal follow-up
 imp NR : h15 direction?
 jansteen 3d*:  White would b13 and make black's stones float
 jansteen 3d*:  So what's black's move here?
]
;B[cf]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  Very big this move
 jansteen 3d*:  This move is better than b13
 imp NR : big but slow:)
 jansteen 3d*:  b13 would allow sente moves for white like d12
]
;W[eo]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  This move is white's priviledge
]
;B[gp]
;W[ch]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  And of course white prevents black c11
]
;B[dh]
;W[di]
;B[eh]C[
 imp NR : not e11?
 imp NR : isn't that normal here?
 jansteen 3d*:  Black doesn't want to lose b12 imp
 imp NR : ah, b not really weak yes
 jansteen 3d*:  So white doesn't see a way to continue the attack here
 jansteen 3d*:  Then taking territory seems wise :)
 jansteen 3d*:  Where?
 fezzic 8k : top middle?
 zli 8k*: g6
]
;W[jc]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  This move sets up a large m18 move
 imp NR : good russell:)

 jansteen 3d*:  Now real endgame started since all groups are settled
 jansteen 3d*:  Very good tiger, you noticed!
 jansteen 3d*:  White could have played better here by playing f10 peep
 jansteen 3d*:  before playing j12
 imp NR : strange that b never made an attack on the w o8 group...
 jansteen 3d*:  In that case black can not get out to the bottom and has to go along the top middle
 jansteen 3d*:  That would give white more territory in the center
